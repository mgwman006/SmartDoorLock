# SmartDoorLock
## Cellular Smart Door Locker With web interface processor â€“ Investigation of IoT technology and PCB board designing


### Description
Smart Door Lock is the door lock with a numeric keypad interface which interacts
with the user to send a pin code to the lock system as a request to access the door,
It also has a WebApp interface which allow a user to communicate with
processor/server in order to control the lock in some features such as remote
opening and closing of the door, and changing the password of the locker.
Although the project aim is 80% focusing on solving the problems of the college's
dormitory doors where some dishonest students trying to make copies of the key
and may be using it in the future to steal some stuffs from the room, this is unethical
manner and it is hard to monitor it physical. But through a smart locker each year a
new student can use a web interface to change the password/pin code of the door.
Also, this project can be used at renting houses or offices where a new tenant does
not need buy or make new locker, on top of that there is no longer need to walk with
keys and trying to take care of it all the time.

Why Cellular? It is planned to make a device independent and giving all control
power of internet to the user and not the external devices like Wi-Fi Access Point
because the failure of the external device may affect the performance of a Lock.
In this project, one of the major objectives is to prepare a PCB board special for the
door lock which will only have the chips needed for the specific functions of the door
locker, hopeful by doing this will minimize the power budget of the system.

### Deliverables

The following is a list of desirable outcomes for this project:
1. Prototyping of the project on Veroboard
2. Report
3. WebApp Application as User Interface to interact with door lock system
4. Battery life estimations
5. Recommendation on alternative sustainable source of power.
6. Results on the Investigation and uses of a Thingstream/MQTT IoT technologies on
WebApp
7. Results on the investigation of the principles of Electronic Circuit designing
processes


### GA1: Problem solving: (Identify, formulate, analyse and solve complex* engineering problems )

This project requires the design and implementation embedded system with
backend integration. The student will need to identify the various subcomponents and tools required to fulfil the task. A design and documentation
of the implementation should produced.

### GA 4**: Investigations,experiments and analysis 
1. An investigation into the tools required to design, build and implement the
critical components of the system
2. Experimentation into the ability of the system to reliably automate the
functions the smart door locker.
3. Analyse system resource utilisation and optimize for efficient resource use
